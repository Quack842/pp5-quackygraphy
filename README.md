# Project Goals

The Goal of this project was to build a Social Media Platform based website so users can upload their best shot pictures they have taken with their professional cameras, or even their smartphone! The user can show which camera they used and what category the shot was based on.

<u>The key functionality of the Website:</u>

- The website should be simple and easy to navigate across all the pages.
- User Authentication so users can't edit other users profiles, posts and comments.
- User interaction via posts, comments and profiles
- Users to have their own profiles with a brief description, profile image and their preferred camera that they like to use.
- CRUD functionality for posts, comments and their profile.
- Posts can be filtering by keyword search of profile name, camera_type and photo_type
- Responsiveness to allow pleasant usage of the app across a range of devices with varying display sizes

# User Experience

## User Requirements and Expectations
- A site which provides a high level of interactiveness between users
- Links and functions to act as expected
- Notification to provide feedback on expected function outcomes
- Simple "to the point" content that a user can easily digest
- Accessibility for impaired users
- Responsiveness to allow pleasant use across devices of different screen sizes 

## User Stories

[Table Of Contents ⇧](#ta)

I have included links to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Quack842/pp5-quackygraphy/issues) for this project, as well as the [KANBAN board](https://github.com/users/Quack842/projects/4). There are multiple Coloumns that I added other than the default "Todo", "In Progress" and "Done" and their reason/uses are as follow:
 1. Maybe Add
    - Ideas I got while creating the app I would put in this coloumn. Or Ideas that people have suggested afterwards. The issues places in this column was not a priority and I could work on these after I had time.
2. Buggy
    - This Column was created so I can log any errors or bugs to this issue that I have noticed or what other people have noticed while testing the site for me.
3. Dropped
    - This Column was created for the features I thought I wanted to add, but at the end of the project, decided to drop the issue. Some of the Issues that was also added at the "Maybe Add" was moved to the "Dropped" column.

![User Stories](/docs/readme/user-stories.png)

## Site Owner Stories
30. As the site owner, I would want to validate users' data entries on sign up so that users can create a log in which meets the requirements.
31. As the site owner, I would want to ensure only logged in users can post from their account and edit their profile so that data privacy is ensured.
32. As the site owner, I would want to have the ability to remove posts and posts comments so that I can keep the app clean and friendly.
33. As the site owner, I would want the site to be fully responsive so that users can use it across multiple devices and create a good user experience.
34. As the site owner, I would want to use the app search function so that I can search for particular post by their title, camera_type, photo_type and Username.

# Technical Design
[Back to top ⇧](#quacky-graphy) <br />
[Table Of Contents ⇧](#table-of-contents)

## Colors
The Color Scheme was based of the Main Dukky Icon. I started with the Yellow and used [Coolers Palette generator](https://coolors.co/) to generate complementary colors.

![Color Scheme](/docs/readme/color-scheme.png)

## Fonts
Google Fonts were implemented on the website and [FontJoy](https://fontjoy.com/) was used to generate compatible fonts that will work well together.
- Coiny - Used for importand text and Big Fonts
- Shadows Into Light - For Big Main Fonts (To make a statement)
- Varela Round - Was used for all other fonts

## Wireframes
CorelDraw was used to create wireframes of the sites pages, as I am personally more use to using This application.
After starting with the website, I made a few changes like the design but the color scheme and base design stayed the same more or less. There wasn't really a design for the mobile devices, but It was kept in mind while development. The design for the comment section also came to me while developing the website, I knew that I wanted to have a chat bubble effect that changes color for every second comment. This was the final design for the comments:

# Technologies Used
[Back to top ⇧](#quacky-graphy) <br />
[Table Of Contents ⇧](#table-of-contents)

## Coding Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React

## Frameworks and Tools

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Axios is a Promise API. Justification: I used axios to send API requests from the React project to the API and avoid any CORS errors when sending cookies.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - Library to decode JSON Web token. Justification: I used JWT to securely transmit data and to have the ability to verify that the content has not been tampered with.
- [React 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Justification: To be able to showcase my newly learnt skills and for building interactive user interfaces quickly.
- [React-Bootstrap 2.7.2](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - CSS framework. Justification: I used Bootstrap React library for UI components, styling and responsiveness.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - React library. Justification: I used this component to load content (tasks/comments/users) automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page without having to jump to next/previous page.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - Javascript framework for routing. Justification: I used this library to enable navigation between views of components and to have the ability to control what is presented to the user based on the URL they have accessed in the browser.
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - Website responsive test site. I used this to create the multi-device mock-up at the top of this README.md file
- [CorelDraw](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/?link=wm) - Designers Application. I used this to create the projects wireframes
- [Chrome dev tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) - I used this for debugging of the code and checking site for responsiveness
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - File storage. I used this to store static files
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon library. I used this to style the site with icons.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font library. I used this to import fonts
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Cloud based hosting service. I used this as a remote repository to store project code
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) - Cloud development environment. I used this to host a virtual workspace
- [Code Anywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) - Cloud development environment, it is simular to Gitpod. Used this when my credits ran out on GitPod
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) A Source Editor. When Code Anywhere failed me (Like many others) I decided to move all mo code to VS Code.
- Validation:
  - [WC3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML Validator. I used this to validate the applications HTML code
  - [Jigsaw W3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - CSS Validator. I used this to validate the applications CSS code
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - JavaScript Validator. I used this to validate applications JSX code
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) Site auditing tool. I used this to validate performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO of the application
- [Gif Creator](https://imgflip.com/gif-maker) This website was used to make my image, that is on the "Page not Found", from 3 png images to 1 gif image.
- [Background Generator](https://app.haikei.app/) This website was used to generate the page background and the button's backgrounds.
- [CSS Box Shadow Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) This website was used to generate a box shadow that was used through out the code.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) This website was used to help fix bug and errors that showed up during development.

| **Bug** | **Fix** | **Image** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A tester brought up a problem with the Post edit/create form. When they add an image that is not valid, the warning message shows, but does not go away when they reselect the an image. | I fixed this by adding code to clear the error when a user reselects an image | ![Bug Image](/docs/readme/bug-clear-image-error.png) |
| The Form for the Create and Edit Forms looked "Wonky" when used on a mobile | I Changed the stying of Col span. The Image shows the Bug | ![Bug](/docs/readme/bugs-create-edit-form.png) |
| When the user tries to change their camera type on their profile, it does not update, It stays as "All". The code on the front-end seems perfect so I knew the problem was not in the front-end. | After a long struggle, I finally realized that the problem had to be in the back-end. I noticed that I added the camera_type to the serializers. I know it is technically a back-end bug report, but I noticed the problem in the front-end.  | N/B 
| A tester informed me that when they selected the "Compact Digital Camera", not the enitre word was formatted and only the first half. | I fixed this by changing the formatType in the ProfilePage. | ![Bug](/docs/readme/bug-camera-type-format-error.png) ![Bug](/docs/readme/bug-format-text-fixed.png) |

There was a Few More Errors and Bugs, but unfortunatly I didn't document them all because typically when I code, I fix the problem while coding, these bugs that I list Here, Was suggested/shows by People I asked to help test my website

The other Bugs is Mentioned in the [Credits](#credits) Section even though it was bugs and errors, It was Thanks to these articles that I could Fix them.

- Main credit goes to Code Institute Tutorial Project, used through as a basis for the creation of this API. Originally wanted to build an app based around dungeon and dragons and the type of players they can build, but unfortunalty, I'm away for 2 weeks before my upload deadline. So I kept it simple.

- The Following StackOverflow articles helped me figure out a few problems I ran into whilst Developing:
  1. In The App.js file, the follow along tutorial used the <Switch></Switch>, but that didn't work in my Project since I use a newer version of React. This article Helped me fix that problem.

  2. The Links used in the App.js file for the "Page Not found", didn't work following the Walkthrough. This article helped me fix the problem.

  3. I struggled with this one for a long while, because I didn't know that the useHistory is not used in the newer version. This article was the biggest help off all! Because even the tutors tried heling but because most students keep using the older version used in the walkthough, they didn't know what was wrong ether.
